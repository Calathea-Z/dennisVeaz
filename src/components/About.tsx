						From the age of 4, when he first sat down at his grandmother's
						organ, music has been his lifelong passion. This early start paved
						the way for years of exploration, from touring in bands to composing
						intricate soundscapes for multimedia. His musical influences span a
						diverse rangeâ€”from the improvisational energy of jam bands to the
						complex harmonies of jazz and the timeless beauty of classical
						music.

						In the realm of video game music, Dennis draws inspiration from
						modern composers like Lena Raine and Wilbert Roget, II, while paying
						homage to the classics created by legends such as Koji Kondo and
						David Wise. With every project, his goal is to craft immersive and
						memorable soundtracks that resonate with players long after the game
						is over.
